             <p> This is a webpage I started for this week's assignement. I put some images of the stuff into in here.
                I just thought it would look cooler than something generic. I've been playing around with some goofy colors as well.
                I guess some potential employers could look at this for my work samples. The first one probably doesn't tell you much.
                I didn't even make that webpage. I just edited the HTML file to make it more readable. There were a bunch of div elements
                in places where there could have been semantic tags. I'm actually doing part of this assignment at my job right now.
                I work in a dispensary in Morton Grove, IL, currently. They let me work on my homework and it's not a problem. Isn't that cool?
                However, I don't see myself working here forever. Hopefully, after this class I will have acquired some understanding of full-stack
                web development and be able to apply it. Right now I feel like I'm piecing it together. It's a lot of information and concepts.
                I am utilizing the tutors, classmates, and other resources such as youtube and W3 for help/guidance. So far they have been quite useful.
                        </p>
             <p> So, a little more context about me. My name is Max Blaul. I am 25 years old and I'm from Evanston, IL,
                currently residing in Wilmette. I graduated from Columbia College Chicago in late 2019 with a BA in Music
                Business Management. My main ambition in life is to be a musician and to be in bands. Earlier that year,
                I joined the jam band Totem Frogs, playing bass guitar. I met the group through an app that facilitated networking between musicians.
                For the last few years I've been playing almost exclusively with the Frogs. We currently consist of 2 guitars, bass, drums, and a keyboard;
                played by Alex, Matt, myself, Matthew and Josh respectively. We've been together in this lineup since May of this year.
                After I graduated from Columbia in 2019/early 2020, there were not many available jobs in the music business field. Because of the
                Covid-19 pandemic, there was not really much live entertainment going on. So the only available job in music I could find
                was working at my local Guitar Center. I worked there for about two-and-a-half years. I quit this April due to the company just being awful
                and them not paying me adequately. As may have alluded to earlier, I currently work at MedMen in Morton Grove. The job is really easy and I barely
                have to do anything. Which has emobldened me to try and gain some more in-demand hard skills. Unfortunately, people aren't paying me thousands of dollars
                a year to play bass yet. That's just a sad and harsh reality of life that I'm going to have to deal with for a while. Until that becomes a reality, I
                need to do something that makes decent money that isn't retail. So then a friend of mine suggested I look into coding and how to make websites/debug etc. 
                When he told me what his day-to-day routine consisted of, it aligned pretty well with my life visioin and goals. So after a few Google searches and delving
                into different programs offered by different instituttions, it brought me here to Northwestern. This coding class is the newest and most exciting challenge 
                I have in my life right now. Can't wait to make some killer code!
